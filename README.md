Intune Autopilot + Hybrid Azure AD Join Lab

This project demonstrates a full end‑to‑end modern device lifecycle using Windows Autopilot, Intune, and Hybrid Azure AD Join.
It simulates how an enterprise provisions, enrolls, secures, and manages Windows devices using cloud‑based and hybrid identity.

What This Lab Covers

• 	Collecting and importing Autopilot hardware hashes
• 	Creating and assigning Autopilot deployment profiles
• 	Configuring Hybrid Azure AD Join (Cloud Sync or AAD Connect)
• 	Setting up the Service Connection Point (SCP)
• 	Enabling device registration via GPO
• 	Enrollment Status Page (ESP) configuration
• 	Intune compliance policies
• 	Conditional Access based on device compliance
• 	Win32 app packaging and deployment
• 	Troubleshooting Autopilot and Hybrid Join issues
**
Architecture Overview**
Workflow:
User unboxes device → Autopilot → Hybrid Join → Intune MDM enrollment → Compliance → Conditional Access → App deployment.
This mirrors a real enterprise onboarding experience.
